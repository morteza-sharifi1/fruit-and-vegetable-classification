# fruit-and-vegetable-classification
This repository contains the code and data for a fruit and vegetable classification project. The project uses a dataset of 120 different fruits and vegetables to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of fruits and vegetables. The CNN is able to achieve an accuracy of 94% on the test set.

## Requirements
Python 3
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
TensorFlow

# Instructions
1- Clone the repository.
2- Install the requirements.
3- Run the fruit_and_vegetable_classification.ipynb notebook to train the CNN and evaluate its performance.

# Data
The data for this project is available on Kaggle. The dataset contains 82,213 images of fruits and vegetables, divided into a training set, a test set, and a multi-fruits set. The images are 100x100 pixels in size.

# Results
The CNN was able to achieve an accuracy of 94% on the test set. This means that the CNN was able to correctly classify 94% of the images in the test set.
